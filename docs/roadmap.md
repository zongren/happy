# Happy Roadmap

## Next Up

- Start using as the daily development driver
- Contributing guidelines — priority: bugs > ui touchups > new features > refactors > core refactors (sync engine, rpc, server changes). Get notified about all issue activity on github — just start using inbox?
- Start tweeting about changes with images / videos

## Table Stakes (catch conductor)

- Small UX touchups - too many to list
- Bundled distribution (needed to make my own daily driver)
- Forking a session - for example a session with triaging -> fork into multiple where we fix the specific groups of issues

- File preview / editing in session — see [layout-core.md](layout-core.md)
- Better diff viewer — see [layout-core.md](layout-core.md)

## Navigation Bugs

Back navigation is broken across the app in several places:
- Logout → restore from key doesn't pop enough screens (also errors out)
- General back navigation inconsistency across flows

## Workspaces & Checkouts

Missing the concept of **workspace** (aka project) that spans multiple machines, and **checkout** as a daemon-managed entity.

- Workspace = a logical project that can span multiple machines (e.g. my laptop + cloud dev box both working on the same repo)
- Checkout = a specific working copy on a specific machine, managed by the daemon
- Currently we have machines and paths but no first-class workspace grouping
- Daemon should manage checkout lifecycle: create worktree, switch branch, clean up stale checkouts
- Right panel context (changes, files) is per-checkout, but workspace groups checkouts across machines

[hard]
- Attachments in composer / in agent output [hard, encrypted attachments, extra storage - needs design]
- Terminal embedded in app

## Underlying Assistant Upkeep

- Bug fixes, especially with session lifecycle management
- Crons / scheduled agents
- Migrate to most up to date vendor sdks
- Better flags support

[nice to have]
- Memory viewing / editing
- Slash commands
- Codex review, other commands
- Tighter MCP / tool ecosystem hooks
- Keep up as vendors ship new features

- Cleaner protocol + unit tests

## Viral / Cool

- Multi-agent dispatch
  - Fan-out N agents across machines
  - Agents dispatching agents (you just watch)
  - Orchestration UI (progress, results, cost)
- Software factories / maintenance factory
  - Repeatable agent pipelines
  - Own repo as first customer — self-maintaining
- Voice
  - Dispatch agents by talking
  - Voice as the control layer

## Talk to Users & Community

- Reach out to 5 users directly
- Read app store / google play reviews
- In-app surveys / feedback chat
- Contribution guidelines + PR template
- Post about latest version
- Engage with open PRs / community contributions

## Growth

- Semi-autonomous posting
  - Nudge-tweet after each ship
  - Watch git activity → draft posts
- Semi-automated engagement
  - Find relevant people / conversations
  - Draft replies, human approves
- Twitter / HN / socials presence

## Session / Project Management

- Reorder / prioritize sessions in sidebar

## Customization

- UI self-customization ("change X" → happy obliges)
- Custom widgets per session / project
- Widgets on mobile (iOS/Android) + desktop

## Push Notification Routing

Current state: server stores bare Expo push tokens per account with no device metadata. All registered devices get all notifications — no routing intelligence.

- Smart routing: use presence/activity signals (last active device, which device has the session open) to route notifications to the right device instead of blasting all
  - Server already has presence data (sessionCache, machine connection state) — likely enough to make good routing decisions
  - Suppress notification on the device that originated the action
  - Prefer the device the user is currently active on
- Web push notifications: currently missing entirely — add service worker + web push registration so browser sessions get notifications too
- Device metadata on token registration: store platform (ios/android/web), device name, last active timestamp alongside the push token

## Better Machine Management

- Auth transferring between devices

## Integrations (external services)

- remote machine ecosystem
  - exe.dev — tutorials, outreach
  - sprites — same
- Linear
- GitHub — PR reviews
